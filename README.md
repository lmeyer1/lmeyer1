ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lmeyer1

I'm collaborating in [Prestashop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop). Read my interview https://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-interview-lorenz-meyer/.

I just wrote an article about Prestashop performance on meduim https://medium.com/@lmeyer./a-look-at-performance-while-upgrading-prestashop-d5c5ac7327f2. Don't hesitate to give me feedback. I would be interested how Prestashop performs in different setups.
